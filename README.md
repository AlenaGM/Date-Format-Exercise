# 🐈‍ Date Format Exercise 🚌
_Function that formats date and time._

JavaScript _'date formatting'_ assignment that was completed in week 17 of learning with [ITGirlSchool].

The task was to write a `formatDate(date)` function that transforms `date` in the following way:

- If the time is less than 1 second from `date`, it should be displayed as `right now`.     
- If the time is less than 1 minute from `date`, it should be displayed as `n seconds ago`.
- If the time is less than 1 hour from `date`, it should be displayed as `n minutes ago`.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the full date and time should be displayed in the format "DD.MM.YY HH:mm".

To make the task more enjoyable, a ⏲-timer and some 🐈‍ + 🚌 animation were added. Enjoy!
